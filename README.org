#+title: ollama.el - Manage Ollama Models from Emacs

* Summary

ollama.el provides an Emacs interface to manage Ollama models, allowing you to list, pull, delete, copy, and inspect models directly from Emacs.

* Why This Exists

You know how we all love playing with local LLMs?

We're constantly pulling models from Ollama, Hugging Face, and everywhere else.

Wouldn't it be awesome to have a neat way to organize all those models right in Emacs?

That's what this is all about!

* Installation

For Doom Emacs users, add this to your =config.el=:

#+begin_src elisp
;; In $DOOMDIR/packages.el
(package! ollama
  :recipe (:host github :repo "nailuoGG/ollama.el"))
#+end_src

Then run:

#+begin_src bash
doom sync
#+end_src
